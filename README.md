# Tubefeeder-extractor

This is a reworked backend for [Tubefeeder](https://github.com/Schmiddiii/Tubefeeder), that is in very early stages but will soon be used as a the new backend.
This could of course also be used for other projects.

## Supported Features

Currently only subscribing to a channel is supported, with plans to integrate playlists, filters and "currently playing".

## Supported Platforms

Currently only Youtube is supported, with plans to add Peertube and Lbry in the future.

## Writing for a new platform

If you would like to support this by writing a new backend, please contact me in the [Tubefeeder Matrix Room](https://matrix.to/#/%23tubefeeder:matrix.org?via=matrix.org).

## Documentation

Documentation is currently very bare-bone and will follow soon-ish.
